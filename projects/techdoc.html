    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the structure of a web page. It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information about the page to the browser. Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give meaning to content.</p>
    
    <code>This is an <> opening tag and </> closing tag.</code><br>
    <code>< p >Im a paragraph tag!< / p ></code><br>
    <code>Comments in HTML start with < !-- and end with -- ></code><br>
    <code>HTML5 offers more descriptive tags such as header, footer, nav, video, article, and section.</code><br>
    <code>To add an img to your code you must use an < img > tag that includes the src="" attribute.</code><br><br>

<p>CSS, tell the browser how to display the text and other content you write in HTML.
  Note that CSS is case-sensitive so be careful with your capitalization. CSS has been adopted by all major browsers and allows you to control color, fonts, positioning, spacing, sizing, decorations, and transitions.</p>
  <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS styling. You can apply inline styles directly to HTML elements with a style attribute. Alternatively, you can place CSS rules within style tags in an HTML document. Finally, you can write CSS rules in an external style sheet, then reference that file in the HTML document. Even though the first two options have their use cases, most developers prefer external style sheets because they keep the styles seperate from the HTML elements.This improves the readability and reusability of your code. The idea behind CSS is that you can use a selector to target an HTML element in the DOM (Document Object Model) and then apply a variety of attributes to that element to change the way it is displayed on the page.</p>

    <p>Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.</p>
    <p>The basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience.In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.</p>

      <p>"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. this includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities. websites should be open and accessible to everyone, regardless of a users abilities or resources. some users rely on assistive technology such as a screen reader or voice recognition software. other users may be able to navigate through a site only using a kayboard.</p>
      <p>keeping the needs of various users in mind when developing your project can go a long way towards creating an open web. here are three general concepts that are important to stay focused on: have well organized code that uses appropriate markup, ensure text alternatives exist for non-text and visual content, and create an easily-navigated page thats keyboard-friendly. having accessible web content is an ongoing challenge. a great resource for your projects going forward is the w3 consortiums web content accessibility guidelines (wcag). they set the international standard for accessibility and provide a number of criteria you can use to check your work.</p>

        <p>Today, there are many types of devices that can access the web. they range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. these devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and proccessing power. responsive web design is an approach to designing web content that responds to the constraints of different devices. the page structure and css rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences. in general, design the pages css to your target audience.</p>
        <p>if you expect most of your traffic to be from mobile users, take a 'mobile-first' approach. then add conditional rules for larger screen sizes. if your visitors are desktop users, then design for larger screens with conditional rules for smaller sizes. css gives you the tools to write different style rules, then apply them depending on the device displaying the page. here is an introduction to some of the challenges i have encountered during responsive web design:</p> <br>
